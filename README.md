# tic-tac-toe
A practice project completed as part of the Complete Python From Zero to Hero Bootcamp by Jose Portilla on Udemy. Completed in 2020.

In the classic tic tac toe game, there are two players playing against each other and the first one to get a full row of X or O wins. The code gives a simple visual representation to the player input and keeps on going until one of the player wins or a draw must be announced.
